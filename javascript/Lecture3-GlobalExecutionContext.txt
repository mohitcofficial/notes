When we run our code , global execution context is created and JS Engine creates a global object called window .
Window objects contains many variables and functions which are created by JS Engine. We can access window object from anywhere in the program .

*Anything that is not inside a function is global space.

var variables and function statements that are  in global space is stored in global object.

variable is 'undefined' means that variable has occupied memory but not initialized.
variable is 'not defined' means that the variable has not occupied any memory.

Javascript is a dynamically typed language : 
=>In JS , we don't specify the type of data when we are going to store in the variable .
=>The variables are assigned data types at runtime based on value. 

Javascript is a weakly/loosely typed language because it handles conversions automatically.
Eg: x = 5; console.log(x + '5')		//55 , here x gets automatically converted to string
